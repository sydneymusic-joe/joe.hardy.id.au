		<h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">Joe Hardy builds great teams</h1>

		<p>I am a senior technology leader with 25 years of experience.</p>

		<p>I understand how to engage people, to get teams aligned and to focus on what's important.</p>

		<p>I believe that the individual's attachment to their work will transform the output you get from it.</p>

		<p>I believe that flow and focus, creativity and autonomy, direction and empowerment are essential attributes in the DNA of a good team.</p>

		<p>And most importantly, I know that a team's effectiveness should be measured by the outcomes they produce.</p>

		<p>I use elements of Product Thinking, LEAN, Agile, and many additional techniques and approaches which have really only clicked into place via experience and practice.</p>

		<p>But with that said, every team is different, so every environment requires listening, understanding, empathy and inquiry before action.</p>

		<p>I love building amazing teams.</p>
