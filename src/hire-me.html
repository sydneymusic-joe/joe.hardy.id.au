		<h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">I build great teams</h1>

		<p>I am a senior technology leader with 25 years of experience.</p>

		<p>I understand how to engage people, to get teams aligned and to focus on what's important.</p>

		<p>I believe that the individual's attachment to their work will transform the output you get from it.</p>

		<p>I believe that flow and focus, creativity and autonomy, direction and empowerment are essential attributes in the DNA of a good team.</p>

		<p>Most importantly, I know that a team's effectiveness should be measured by the outcomes they produce.</p>

		<p>I use elements of Product Thinking, LEAN, Agile, and many additional techniques and approaches which have really only clicked into place via experience and practice.</p>

		<p>But with that said, every team is different, so every environment requires listening, understanding, empathy and inquiry before action.</p>

		<p>I love building amazing teams.</p>

		<h2>SydneyMusic.net (2022 - now)</h2>

		<p>I'm the creator and co-founder of SydneyMusic.net, a not-for-profit community discovery project. The communities we're interested in tend to enjoy loud music performed live, but we think the concept behind SydneyMusic could be used in a diverse range of applications.</p>
		<p>We have no revenue model and no funding, save for a limited amount of merch sold on our online store. Our only focus is on making Sydney's incredibly rich music community more visible.</p>
		<p>It's our mission for 2024 to figure out how to make this sustainable while staying true to the project's central aims.</p>

		<h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">Previously</h1>
		<h2>Companies I've worked with ...</h2>

		<p>... include <strong>Seven West Media</strong>, <strong>Nine Entertainment</strong>, <strong>Squiz</strong>, <strong>Southern Cross Austereo</strong>, <strong>Freeview Australia</strong>, <strong>EMI</strong>, <strong>Universal Music</strong>, <strong>Junkee Media</strong>, <strong>SSW</strong>, <strong>CultureCounts</strong>, <strong>Praxa</strong>.</p>

		<h2>Built the team that built the online destinations for <a href="https://www.thewest.com.au">The West Australian</a> and <a href="https://www.perthnow.com.au">PerthNow</a></h2>
		<p>2015 was the year <strong>The West Australian</strong> (part of <strong>Seven West Media</strong>) began their first-ever foray into a self-owned digital strategy.</p>
		<p>An opportunity of a lifetime, I moved to Perth to understand what building a digital platform from scratch in a century-old newsroom would look like.</p>
		<p>I built a team of product managers and engineers in real-time while we began to conceive, plan and execute on the platform design and architecture, while also supporting the acquisition of <strong>PerthNow</strong> from <strong>News Corporation</strong>.</p>
		<p>A proud team got the first public go-live of <a href="https://thewest.com.au">thewest.com.au</a> out in 8 months from the first line of code being written. A completely rebuilt <a href="https://www.perthnow.com.au">PerthNow</a> followed a few months later. We also shipped a React Native iOS and Android app, a footy tipping product, and did award-winning executions for elections and other major news events. Oh, and we won the Walkleys/Global Editors Network hackathon twice.</p>
		<p>Seven West Media went on to use the same platform for <a href="https://www.7news.com.au">7News</a>.</p>

		<h2>Guided Seven's Winter Olympics and Commonwealth Games 2018 Web/Mobile/CTV online experience to completion</h2>
		
		<p>I was brought back to Sydney by Seven West Media, midway through their effort to build a consumer live-streaming experience for the 2018 Winter Olympics and Commonwealth Games.</p>
		<p>The product scope, commercials and plan were all set, but the project was off the rails.</p>
		<p>With team attrition beginning to accelerate, I was brought in to help get things back on track. We succeeded by revitalising the team culture, getting our planning and delivery in order, and nailing the technical quality of service multiple high-stakes live events.</p>
		<p>We also had a great time doing it.</p>

		<h2>Created Squiz's Product Engineering function and facilitated their technology transformation into a SaaS company</h2>

		<p>How do you get a 20-year-old web development and hosting services company to become a SaaS product organisation?</p>
		<p>Led as part of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattadney/">Matt Adney</a>'s product strategy, I consolidated 4 disparate, unaffiliated engineering teams into a united engineering team, bringing together multiple decades of different practices, culture and technology.</p>
		<p>While refashioning our ways of working to meet an agile product thinking-led mindset, we broke ground on building a new SaaS platform, transforming decades-old custom-built products to meet the needs of modern customer expectations and leveraging cloud-native thinking for the first time in the organisation's history.</p>

		<h2>Helped Nine Entertainment rescue deteriorating systems responsible for $1.2B p.a. of their revenue</h2>

		<p>Nine have bespoke systems built 10-15 years ago that are responsible for the end-to-end operational workflows for every part of their linear (TV and radio) broadcasts - ad bookings, planning, reconciliation, optimisation, billing, schedule management, EPGs, playout, regulatory compliance - all run by two monolithic software systems built in .NET.</p>
		<p>These systems, responsible for $1.2B p.a. of Nine's revenue, were falling apart. The technology leadership saw a velocity problem while trying to get a major project delivered, and were trying to make the teams go faster. Instead, the software began to rapidly deteriorate with potentially catastrophic consequences.</p>
		<p>A stream of resignations from the team meant there was no one in the business with comprehensive technical knowledge of the systems. There was also no documentation of any current standard, many systems weren't being backed up, and severe incidents were occurring on a near-daily basis.</p>
		<p>We got things under control, and we did this by:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Placing an emphasis on transparent communication and human-centred values</li>
			<li>Creating a strategy to understand what was important</li>
			<li>Implementing OKRs to measure our progress towards our goals</li>
			<li>Securing investment to get the support we needed to fix our problems</li>
			<li>Implementing a Platform team construct</li>
			<li>Leadership growth and coaching</li>
			<li>The introduction of a product function</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The team is now healthier, happier, and has more control over their environment than ever before.</p>

		<h2>And now?</h2>
		<p>I've left Nine to be better enabled to focus on my family and SydneyMusic.</p>
		<p>I am freelancing. If you have a need for anything of what you see above, feel free to get in touch.</p>

		<h2>The Gate and other live music ventures</h2>
		<p>I co-founded and ran The Gate (2010 - 2013), a live music initiative championing emerging music and providing high quality production values in a DIY paradigm. We sought to pay artists fairly within a completely sponsorship-free and non-alcohol dependent financial model.</p>

		<p>Central to our mission was making live music accessible to all ages while placing an emphasis on community.</p>
